# Text Encryption App
Text-input encrypt using various algorithms.
### Project background
This project is presented by `E.M.C.P. Ekanayake` and `G.A.G.C. Dilanka` as a group project on the subject of "Information Assurance and Security" (MIT - 222).
### Project Introduction

Users communicate overall on social media, but messages are not secured when it passes through the network. An intruder can access a userâ€™s message easily. To secure users' communication overall social media or anywhere require text security, we can encrypt the message which cannot understand by a third party. In this project we are presenting an android application to demonstrate user-entered plain text and select the algorithm type from AES, DES, MD5... and provide the key, a chipper text will be formed that can be sent via any communication application and the end-user can decrypt the text by selecting the same algorithm type and must enter the same sender secret key. Users can use our application and can enter the plain text and must select the algorithm type and must enter the secret key to encrypt the message and the receiver can decrypt the message by specifying the same algorithm used for encryption and must use the same secret key used by the sender.  The intruder will find it difficult to decrypt the message. By using this method you can double ensure that your secret message is sent securely without outside interference from hackers or crackers. If the sender sends this image in public others will not know what is it, and it will be received by the receiver. You will need the key and algorithm type to decrypt the encrypted text.
